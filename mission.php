        <br>
        With too many faces from too many places, we are one place for all of your <strong>creative</strong> needs.

        <h4 class="Helvetica">
        <strong>YourPeople</strong> is a national organization that recruits hobbyists, enthusiasts, and amateurs to professionalize and commercialize the work they do. There are too many creatives (graphic designers/musicians/videographers/artists/ writers/sound designers/ etc.) out there that maintain a professional caliber but lack in professional experience. We give those who possess talents, skills, and ideas a professional structuring and the resources needed to become sources of content production. <strong>YourPeople</strong> has a rigorous application process that ensures that those who we hire deliver the quality everyone deserves. Through our far reaching recruitment process, we have sealed and sheltered many diverse and creative individuals. Thus ensuring that your creative and commercial needs be specifically met. We are one place for everything because we do everything. Whether you need a commercial made, a song crafted, a design generated, a website fabricated, or any creation created, our creative creators can create it.

        <h2 class="Arial-Black">The Problem</h2>
        <h4 class="Helvetica">
        <span><font size="5">Small</font></span> companies and freelancers encounter <span><font size="1">big</font></span> problems. For instance, it's hard to have an existence in a world that is made to seem as big as the universe. Over the last few decades, more and more money is needed to reach the attention of consumers, who are now conditioned to think that only what is widely distributed is important. For someone to do something, they must compete with everyone and everything. Small and individual voices lost in the confusing cacophony of our contemporary culture. So let us atoms bond and band together into bigger... I don't know how to finish this analogy. Individually, we are individuals struggling to struggle through our specific paths. Competition.
        Isolation. Failure.  Collectively, we are STRONGER, BIGGER, and whatever other good ADJECTIVE you want to toss into this sentence.

        <br>
        <h2 class="Arial-Black">The Solution</h2>
        <h4 class="Helvetica">
        <strong>OUR</strong> goal is <strong>YOUR</strong> goal because <strong>WE</strong> are <strong>YOUR PEOPLE</strong>. We know that sounds“businessy,” but we are a business. We are also MORE than that. We are a we, which means we understand the problems that we all face.
        By banding together an ARMY OF ARTISTS, we are fully equipped to do whatever it is YOU need DONE. To solve whatever solution that needs to be solved. And remember, we here at <strong>YourPeople</strong> are your people. And if you forget, just read this again.
